## AWS Well-Architected Framework

- The AWS Well-Architected Framework `describes key concepts, design principles, and architectural best practices` for `designing and running workloads in the cloud`

- By answering a few foundational questions, `learn how well your architecture aligns with cloud best practices` and `gain guidance for making improvements`

## Six Pillars

1. Operational Excellence

- Focuses on `running and monitoring systems`, and `continually improving processes and procedures`

- Key topics include
  - Automating changes
  - Responding to events
  - Defining standards to manage daily operations

2. Security

- Focuses on `protecting information and systems`

- Key topics include
  - Confidentiality and integrity of data
  - Managing user permissions
  - Establishing controls to detect security events

3. Reliability

- Focuses on `workloads performing their intended functions` and `how to recover quickly from failure` to meet demands

- Key topics include
  - Distributed system design
  - Recovery planning
  - Adapting to changing requirements

4. Performance Efficiency

- Focuses on `structured and streamlined allocation of IT and computing resources`

- Key topics include
  - Selecting resource types and sizes optimized for workload requirements
  - Monitoring performance
  - Maintaining efficiency as business needs evolve

5. Cost Optimization

- Focuses on `avoiding unnecessary costs`

- Key topics include
  - Understanding spending over time and controlling fund allocation
  - Selecting resources of the right type and quantity
  - Scaling to meet business needs without overspending

6. Sustainability

- Focuses on `minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads`

- Key topics include
  - A shared responsibility model for sustainability
  - Understanding impact
  - Maximizing utilization to minimize required resources and reduce downstream impacts
