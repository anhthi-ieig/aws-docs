## AWS CodePipeline - Release software using continuous delivery

- AWS CodePipeline is `a continuous delivery(CD) service` that enables you `to model, visualize, and automate the steps required to release` your software

- CodePipeline `automates the build, test, and deploy phases` of your release process `every time there is a code change, based on the release model you define`

- CodePipeline cannot deploy the code by itself. Instead, it can integrate with CodeDeploy for the actual deployment

- AWS CodePipeline integrates with AWS services such as

  - AWS CodeCommit
  - AWS CodeBuild
  - AWS CodeDeploy
  - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
  - AWS CloudFormation
  - AWS OpsWorks
  - Amazon ECS
  - AWS Lambda
  - Amazon S3
  - 3rd-party like Github
