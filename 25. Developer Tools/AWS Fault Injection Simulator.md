## AWS Fault Injection Simulator - Improve resiliency and performance with controlled experiments

- AWS Fault Injection Simulator is `a fully managed service` for `running fault injection experiments on AWS` that makes it easier to improve an applicationâ€™s performance, observability, and resiliency

- Fault injection experiments are `used in Chaos Engineering` which is the practice of `stressing an application` in testing or production environments `by creating disruptive events` `to observing how the system responds, and implementing improvements`
