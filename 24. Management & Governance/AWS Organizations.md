# AWS Organizations

- AWS Organizations helps you `centrally govern your environment` such as
  . `Automate account creation` and `manage multiple AWS accounts`
  . `Create groups of accounts` to reflect your business needs
  . `Restrict account privileges using Service Control Policies(SCPs)`
  . `Consolidate billing all of your accounts`
  . `Define central configurations, security mechanisms, and resource sharing across accounts`

- We should `enable CloudTrail to monitor activity on all accounts` for governance, compliance, risk, and auditing purposes.

- We should `use tags to categorize AWS resources for billing purposes`
