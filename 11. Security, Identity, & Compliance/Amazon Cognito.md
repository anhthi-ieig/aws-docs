## Amazon Cognito - Identity management for your apps

- Amazon Cognito `provides authentication, authorization, and user management` for `your web and mobile apps`

- Your users `can sign in directly with a user name and password`, `or through a third party` such as Facebook, Amazon, Google or Apple

- The two main components of Amazon Cognito

  - User Pools: User directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your app users
  - Identity Pools: Enable you to grant your users access to other AWS services

- You can use Identity Pools and User Pools separately or together
