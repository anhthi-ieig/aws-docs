## IAM Roles

- An IAM role is `an IAM identity` that you can `create in your account that has specific permissions`

- Instead of being uniquely associated with one person like an IAM user, a role is `intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it`

- An IAM role `doesn't have standard long-term credentials` such as a password or access keys associated with it. It `just provides you with temporary security credentials` for your role session
