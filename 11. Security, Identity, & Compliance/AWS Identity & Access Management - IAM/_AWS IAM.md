## AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM) - Securely manage access to services and resources

- AWS IAM is `a web service` that helps you `securely control access to AWS resources`. You use IAM to `control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources`

- Using IAM, you can `create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources`
