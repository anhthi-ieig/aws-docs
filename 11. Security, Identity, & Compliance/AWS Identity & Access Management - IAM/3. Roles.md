## Roles

- Role are `IAM identities` you can `create in your account that has specific permissions`

- Instead of being uniquely associated with one person like an IAM user, a role is `intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it`

- Roles `don't have standard long-term credentials` such as a password or access keys associated with it. It `just provides you with temporary security credentials` for your role session
