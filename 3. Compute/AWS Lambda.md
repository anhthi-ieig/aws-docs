## AWS Lambda - Run code without thinking about servers

- AWS Lambda is `a serverless compute service` that lets you `run code on the cloud` `without provisioning or managing servers`

- AWS Lambda `executes your code only when needed` and `scales automatically`, from a few requests per day to thousands per second

- AWS lambda has a `maximum execution time of 15 minutes`

- You will `be charged base on the duration and number of request` but the `free usage tier includes 1 million requests each month`
