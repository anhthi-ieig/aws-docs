## Amazon Machine Images - AMI

- An Amazon Machine Image `provides the template required to launch an EC2 instance`. You must specify an AMI when you launch an EC2 instance

- You can launch `multiple instances from a single AMI` when you `need multiple instances with the same configuration`

- The AMI `must be in the same region as that of the EC2 instance to be launched`

- If the AMI exists in a different region, you `can copy that AMI to the region where you want to launch the EC2 instance`
