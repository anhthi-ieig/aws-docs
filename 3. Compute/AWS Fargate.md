## AWS Fargate - Serverless compute for containers

- AWS Fargate is `a serverless compute engine for containers, like Docker` that works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

- Fargate `eliminates the need to provision and manage servers`, lets you specify and pay for resources per application, and improves security through application isolation by design.
