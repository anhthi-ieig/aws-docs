## AWS Well-Architected Framework

- The AWS Well-Architected Framework `describes key concepts, design principles, and architectural best practices` for `designing and running workloads in the cloud`

- By answering a few foundational questions, `learn how well your architecture aligns with cloud best practices` and `gain guidance for making improvements`

## General Design Principles

1. Stop guessing your capacity needs

2. Test systems at production scale

3. Automate to make architectural experimentation easier

4. Allow for evolutionary architectures

5. Drive architectures using data

6. Improve through game days

## Six Pillars

1. Operational Excellence

- The ability to `support development and run workloads effectively`, `gain insight into their operations`, and to `continuously improve supporting processes and procedures` to deliver business value

- There are five design principles

  - Perform operations as code
  - Make frequent, small, reversible changes
  - Refine operations procedures frequently
  - Anticipate failure
  - Learn from all operational failures

2. Security

- The ability to `protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security`

- There are seven design principles

  - Implement a strong identity foundation
  - Enable traceability
  - Apply security at all layers
  - Automate security best practices
  - Protect data in transit and at rest
  - Keep people away from data
  - Prepare for security events

3. Reliability

- The ability of a workload to `perform its intended function correctly and consistently` when itâ€™s expected to and `operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle`

- There are five design principles

  - Automatically recover from failure
  - Test recovery procedures
  - Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
  - Stop guessing capacity
  - Manage change in automation

4. Performance Efficiency

- `The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency` as demand changes and technologies evolve

- There are five design principles

  - Democratize advanced technologies
  - Go global in minutes
  - Use serverless architectures
  - Experiment more often
  - Consider mechanical sympathy

5. Cost Optimization

- The ability to `run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point`

- There are five design principles

  - Implement Cloud Financial Management
  - Adopt a consumption model
  - Measure overall efficiency
  - Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
  - Analyze and attribute expenditure

6. Sustainability

- `Focuses on environmental impacts, especially energy consumption and efficiency`, since they are important levers for architects to inform direct action to reduce resource usage

- There are six design principles

  - Understand your impact
  - Establish sustainability goals
  - Maximize utilization
  - Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
  - Use managed services
  - Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads
