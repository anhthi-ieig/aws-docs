## Operational Excellence

- The ability to `support development and run workloads effectively`, `gain insight into their operations`, and to `continuously improve supporting processes and procedures` to deliver business value

- There are five design principles

  - Perform operations as code
  - Make frequent, small, reversible changes
  - Refine operations procedures frequently
  - Anticipate failure
  - Learn from all operational failures

## Security

- The ability to `protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security`

- There are seven design principles

  - Implement a strong identity foundation
  - Enable traceability
  - Apply security at all layers
  - Automate security best practices
  - Protect data in transit and at rest
  - Keep people away from data
  - Prepare for security events

## Reliability

- The ability of a workload to `perform its intended function correctly and consistently` when itâ€™s expected to and `operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle`

- There are five design principles

  - Automatically recover from failure
  - Test recovery procedures
  - Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
  - Stop guessing capacity
  - Manage change in automation

## Performance Efficiency

- `The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency` as demand changes and technologies evolve

- There are five design principles

  - Democratize advanced technologies
  - Go global in minutes
  - Use serverless architectures
  - Experiment more often
  - Consider mechanical sympathy

## Cost Optimization

- The ability to `run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point`

- There are five design principles

  - Implement Cloud Financial Management
  - Adopt a consumption model
  - Measure overall efficiency
  - Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
  - Analyze and attribute expenditure

## Sustainability

- `Focuses on environmental impacts, especially energy consumption and efficiency`, since they are important levers for architects to inform direct action to reduce resource usage

- There are six design principles

  - Understand your impact
  - Establish sustainability goals
  - Maximize utilization
  - Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
  - Use managed services
  - Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads
