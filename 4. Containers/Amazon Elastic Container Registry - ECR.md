## Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) - Easily store, manage, and deploy container images

- Amazon ECR is `a fully managed container registry` that makes it easy to `share and deploy container images and artifacts`

- Amazon ECR `eliminates the need to operate your own container repositories` or `worry about scaling the underlying infrastructure`
