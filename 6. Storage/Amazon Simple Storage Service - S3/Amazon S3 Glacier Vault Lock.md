## S3 Glacier Vault Lock

- S3 Glacier Vault Lock allows you to easily `deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual S3 Glacier vaults` with `a vault lock policy`

- You can specify controls such as “write once read many” (WORM) in a vault lock policy and lock the policy from future edits. `Once locked, the policy can no longer be changed`
