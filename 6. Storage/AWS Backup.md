## AWS Backup - Centralized backup across AWS services

- AWS Backup is `a fully managed service` that enables you to `centralize and automate data protection(backup) across on-premises and AWS services`

- AWS Backup `allows you to define a central data protection policy (called a backup plan)` that works across AWS services for compute, storage, and databases

- Once you define your data protection policies and assign AWS resources to the policies, AWS Backup `automates the creation of backups and stores those backups in an encrypted backup vault` that you designate
