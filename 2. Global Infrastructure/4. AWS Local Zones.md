# AWS Local Zones

- AWS Local Zones `place compute, storage, database, and other AWS services` `closer to end-users` because `AWS Regions are not close enough` to meet latency requirements

- We can easily `run highly-demanding applications using AWS services` that `require single-digit millisecond latencies` to your end-users with AWS Local Zones, such as
  . Real-time gaming
  . Media and entertainment content creation
  . AR/VR
  . Engineering simulations
  . Hybrid migrations

- AWS Local Zones `provide a high-bandwidth, secure connection between local workloads` and those running in the AWS Region, allowing you to seamlessly connect to the full range of in-region services through the same APIs and tool sets
