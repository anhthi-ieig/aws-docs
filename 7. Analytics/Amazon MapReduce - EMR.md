## Amazon EMR - Hosted Hadoop framework

- Amazon EMR is `a cloud big data platform` for `running large-scale distributed data processing jobs`, `interactive SQL queries`, `and machine learning (ML) applications` using open-source analytics frameworks such as

  - Apache Spark
  - Apache Hive
  - Presto

- Amazon EMR `uses the Hadoop data processing engine` to conduct computations implemented in the MapReduce programming model

- Amazon EMR lets you `focus on transforming and analyzing your data` without having to worry about managing compute capacity or open-source applications
