# AWS Wavelength

- Brings `AWS compute and storage` services to `the edge of the 5G network`, minimizing the latency to connect to an application from a mobile device

- Used to build applications that `deliver single-digit millisecond latencies` to mobile devices and end-users, such as
  . Game and live video streaming
  . Machine learning inference at the edge
  . Augmented and virtual reality
