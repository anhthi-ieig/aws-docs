# Amazon VPC

- Amazon VPC lets you `provision a logically isolated section` of the AWS cloud `where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define`

- You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including
  . Selection of your own IP address ranges
  . Creation of subnets
  . Configuration of route tables and network gateways

# VPC Peering

- A VPC peering connection is `a networking connection between two VPCs` that enables you to route traffic between them privately

- Instances in either VPC `can communicate with each other` as if they are within the same network

- You can create a VPC peering connection between
  . Your own VPCs
  . VPCs in different regions (also known as an inter-region VPC peering connection)
  . VPCs in two different AWS accounts
