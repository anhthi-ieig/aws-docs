## AWS CloudFormation - Create and manage resources with templates

- AWS CloudFormation lets you `model, provision, and manage AWS and third-party resources` by treating `infrastructure as code`

- More detail, AWS CloudFormation allows you to `use programming languages or a simple text file(JSON or YAML) to model and provision`, in an automated and secure manner, `all the infrastructure and resources needed for your applications` across all regions and accounts
