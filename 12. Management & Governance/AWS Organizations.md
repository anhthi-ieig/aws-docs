## AWS Organizations - Central governance and management across AWS accounts

- AWS Organizations helps you `centrally govern your environment` such as

  - `Automate account creation` and `manage multiple AWS accounts`
  - `Create groups of accounts` to reflect your business needs
  - `Restrict account privileges` using `Service Control Policies(SCPs)`
  - `Consolidate billing all of your accounts` with cheaper prices
  - `Define central configurations`, `security mechanisms`
  - `Sharing resource across accounts`

- We should `enable CloudTrail to monitor activity on all accounts` for governance, compliance, risk, and auditing purposes.

- We should `use tags to categorize AWS resources for billing purposes`

## Service Control Policies

- Service Control Policies are `a type of organization policy` that you can use to `manage permissions in your organization`

- Service Control Policies `offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts` in your organization.
