## What is Cloud Computing

- Cloud computing is the `on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources` through `a cloud services platform` via the Internet with `pay-as-you-go pricing`

- With cloud computing, you `don’t need to make large upfront investments in hardware` and `spend a lot of time on the heavy lifting of managing that hardware`. Instead, you `can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources` you need to power your newest bright idea or operate your IT department

- A cloud services platform such as Amazon Web Services `owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services`, while `you provision and use what you need` via a web application

## 6 Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. Trade Capital Expense For Variable Expense

- You can `pay only when you consume` computing resources, and `pay only for how much you consume` instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them

2. Benefit From Massive Economies Of Scale

- You can `achieve a lower variable cost` because `usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated` in the cloud,

3. Stop Guessing Capacity

- `Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs`. You can `access as much or as little capacity as you need`, and `scale up and down as required` with only a few minutes

4. Increase Speed And Agility

- Able to `launch your resources within a few clicks` which reduces the time to `make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes`

5. Stop Spending Money Running And Maintaining Data Centers

- Let you `focus on your own customers`, `rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers`

6. Go Global In Minutes

- Easily `deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks`. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost
