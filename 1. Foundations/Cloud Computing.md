## What is Cloud Computing

- Cloud computing is the `on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources` through `a cloud services platform` via the Internet with `pay-as-you-go pricing`

- With cloud computing, you `don’t need to make large upfront investments in hardware` and `spend a lot of time on the heavy lifting of managing that hardware`. Instead, you `can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources` you need to power your newest bright idea or operate your IT department

- A cloud services platform such as Amazon Web Services `owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services`, while `you provision and use what you need` via a web application

## 6 Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. Trade capital expense for variable expense

– Instead of `having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before using` them, you can `pay only for what you consume`

2. Benefit from massive economies of scale

- You can `achieve a lower variable cost` than you can get on your own. Because `usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated` in the cloud, providers such as AWS `can achieve higher economies of scale`, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices

3. Stop guessing capacity

- When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You `can access as much or as little capacity as you need`, and `scale up and down as required with only a few minutes`

4. Increase speed and agility

– In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you `reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes`. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower

5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers

- Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing `lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers`

6. Go global in minutes

- Easily `deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks`. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.
