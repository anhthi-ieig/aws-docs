# Cloud Computing Deployment Models

1. Cloud

- A cloud-based application is `fully deployed in the cloud and all parts of the application run in the cloud`

2. Hybrid

- A hybrid deployment is a way to `connect infrastructure and applications` between `cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud`

3. On-Premises

- `The deployment of resources on-premises`, using virtualization and resource management tools, is sometimes called the "private cloud"
