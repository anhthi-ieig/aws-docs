## Key Pair

- A key pair, `consisting of a public key and a private key`, is `a set of security credentials` that `you use to prove your identity when connecting to an Amazon EC2 instance`

- `Amazon EC2 stores the public key on your instance`, and `you store the private key locally` as `a pem file`
