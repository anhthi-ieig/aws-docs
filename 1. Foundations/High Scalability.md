# High Scalability

- Your ability to `increase your capacity` base on the increasing demand of traffic, memory and computing power

- There are 2 types of scalability

  - Vertical Scaling: The ability for a system to `grow by adding more resources (like CPU, RAM) to a single node or machine`
  - Horizontal Scaling: The ability for a system to `grow by adding additional computers or instances`
